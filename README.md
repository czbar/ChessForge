# Chess Forge
A Windows desktop application facilitating chess training.

Its key differentiating feature is a special training mode where users can test themselves against a Workbook. The program will assess users' moves against the content and the comments in the Workbook. It also lets the users to evaluate any move with the chess engine and verify their understanding of the studied positions by playing against the engine from any position in the Workbook.   

A Workbook is a text file containing a variation tree in the CHF format which is an extension of the PGN format. Workbooks can be prepared by 3rd parties (e.g. chess coaches) or by the users themselves. A PGN file can be used as an initial input that Chess Forge will convert to its CHF format allowing the Workbook's author to insert Chess Forge specific commands and comments.
