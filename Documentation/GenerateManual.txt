1. Update (pull from origin) the ChessForge.wiki repository.

2. Run the following Python scripts (stand alone or from the WikiExport solution in Visual Studio)

A) DownloadImages.py
 
Iterates over all .md files in C:/GitHub/ChessForge.wiki 
(i.e. the ChessForge.wiki repo) identifying all lines 
that look like links to images i.e. have a URL with short (36) 
or long GUID (48).

Downloads the images from the identified links and saves them in the
C:/GitHub/Wiki/DownloadedImages folder naming them <GUID>.png

B) UpdateImageLinks.py

Processes all the .md files from the repo, replacing the original 
links to images with ones to the images saved by the previous script
in C:/GitHub/Wiki/DownloadedImages.

Saves the processed .md files in C:/GitHub/Wiki/WikiForPandoc

C) WikiExport

Merges all .md files from C:/GitHub/Wiki/WikiForPandoc listed 
in variable PAGE_ORDER.

Invokes the Pandoc tool to generate a docx output file.

D) WORD macros.

All required macros can be found in the main ChessForge repo
under Utilities\WikiTools.

When or all accessible from the generated WORD document (e.g.
by being part of the Normal template), press Alt+F8 and run
FinalizeDocument.bas.

Save the document and then "Save As" PDF.
