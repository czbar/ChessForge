 { As we have seen from our king and pawn endgames, many endgames come down to a 
single tempo - one player queens and the other player is one square away from 
queening. In these situations, it's crucial to know which positions are won and 
which are drawn. As we shall soon see, this is one example where white is 
winning. } 1. Qf4+ Ke1 { If you are defending this position, you should in

possible, and that both of your pieces should stay on the same color to 
maximally control the board is all you need - no memorization required! }  *

keep these knight, bishop, and king walls in mind. You must get your king up as

you should be trading passive pieces for active pieces, or winning further 
material. }  12. Nc3 Ne7 13. Ne2 Nf5+ 14. Kf2 g5 $3 { Black's knight is clearly 
dominant, and must be kicked. This last move ensures that white cannot follow up 
an eventual g4 with h4, leading to a passed h pawn. In essence, g5!! freezes the

kills the last of white's "counterplay." }  15. g4 Nd6 16. Ng1 { A sad move, but

Get your king up in the endgame! }  22. Re3 Kg6 23. Rd3 { Lasker has found the 
best defensive setup, but his play has been reduced to hoping there's no

through the most important rook endgames to master. Since rook endgames occur in 
9% of all games, there are truly important concepts to learn here! This study is 
split into two parts: the first is for intermediate players rated <2000 lichess, 
and the second is for advanced players >2000 lichess. For those of you at the 
lower end of this rating range, take your time and try to see why other ideas 
may not work out. For those at the top, master these positions so you can nail 
them in blitz games!Please check out the first four studies in this series 
before continuing. Importantly, understanding of the king and pawn endgames will 
be assumed throughout this study.* Beginner endgames you must know

 { I will leave this study with some practical endgame advice about rook 
endgames. In general, the fewer pawns on the board, the more likely the position 
will reach a draw. We have seen a few examples in this study where that is 
exactly the case. Moreover, it is a lot easier to trade pawns when all the pawns 
are on the same side of the board.Therefore, as black in this position, we would 
want to trade off as many pawns as possible in order to reach an eventual 
Philidor position. One method of doing this is to setup our pawns in their 
current configuration, the so-called "wave cutter" pawn structure. In order for 
white to try and make progress by creating a passed pawn, three pawns will have 
to first be traded, leaving black with the desired Philidor position. Black 
should avoid trading rooks because the king and pawn endgames may be winning.In 
rook endgames, 4 vs 3 are often drawn, 3 vs 2 are usually drawn, and 2 vs 1 or 1 
vs 0 are almost always drawn using the techniques we've explored in this study.
