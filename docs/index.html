        <p><b>Chess Forge</b> is a Free and Open Source (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a>)
            Windows desktop application facilitating chess studies and training. </p>

        <p>It can be used to build opening repertoires, study endgames, middle game strategy, and tactics.
            For training, it offers the unique Training Mode, plus two distinct solving modes for exercices.</p>

        <p><b>Chess Forge</b> utilizes lichess.org's public API to bring you the Opening Explorer and Endgame
            Tablebases.
            This includes the list of Top Games for the current position from lichess's master database.
            The games can be conveniently previewed before optional import. </p>

                <p>Chess Forge can be installed on a Windows PC or used as a portable application.</p>
                <p>The simplest way to install the program is to navigate to the download page (click the link below),
                    download the installer, and run it on your PC.
                </p>
                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/chessforge/">Download Page</a>

                <p>
                    Note that currently the installer is not digitally signed, so the browser and/or the Windows system
                    will likely issue a few warnings. </p>

                <p>For detailed information and the instructions on using Chess Forge as a portable application, see the
                    Installation Guide (click the link below).</p>

                <h2>Open a Workbook</h2>
                <p>You can open a workbook from either the local disk or from the ChessForge online library. </p>
                <h3>From a local file</h3>
                <p>Select <code>File->Open</code> from the main menu and choose a workbook.
                    There are a few samples distributed with the installation and you can find them in the
                    <code>Documents/{user_name}/Chess Forge</code> folder.

                <h3>From the online library </h3>
                Alternatively, if your PC is online, select <code>File->Online Library - Public</code> from the main
                menu to open Chess Forge's Public Library.
                Click on any book in the library to view it. </p>

                <p>Click on <code>Study</code> or double click the chapter's title to open the Study view. The image

                <h2>Self-Indexing Study View</h2>
                <p>The Study is shown as a uniquely designed, self-indexing view which includes a Variation Index
                    displayed under the chapter's title.</p>
                <p>The full variation tree is displayed under the Index and is organized into sections/paragraphs
                    corresponding to the index table. This mimicks the experience of reading a chess book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/VariationIndex.jpg" alt="Variation Index" />
                </p>
                <p>Note that as a result, there will typically be no single "main line" in the view.
                    Each "section" has its own "main line".
                </p>
                <p>The index adjusts itself as you edit variations.</p>
                <p>The depth of the index can be instantly increased or decreased by clicking the arrows next to the
                    Index's header.
                    If you decrease the depth to 0, the Index will disappear altogether. You can bring it back by
                    clicking
                    the chapter's title.
                </p>
                <p>The depth setting will be remembered for each study between sessions.</p>
                <p><i>Coming in version 1.8:</i> Each indexed variation can be collapsed or expanded for more
                    convenient/focused viewing.
                    The collapsed/expand state is not remembered between sessions. The view always re-opens with all
                    lines expanded.</p>

            <article class=" release">
                <h2>Games View</h2>
                <p>The Games view is designed for showing a single game at a time.
                    Therefore, unlike the Study view, it does not have the Variation Index and has a single main line.
                    That main line is, of course, the text of the game (i.e. the actual moves as opposed to any comments
                    that may have been added to the game)
                    and is shown in a bolded font.

            <article class=" release">
                <h2>Exercises View</h2>
                <p>In Chess Forge terminology, an exercise is a game fragment starting at any position.
                    It can be a tactical problem, an endgame study, or any other kind of analysis.
                    The Exercise view differs significantly from the other views.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/ExercisesView.jpg" alt="Exercises View" />
                </p>
                <p>It lacks the Scoresheet on the right hand side and when opened for the first time in a session the
                    variation tree (a.k.a. Solution) is hidden.
                    You need to click the <i>Show Solution</i> header to open it.</p>
                <p>The starting position is shown on a small diagram below the headers and there are prominent buttons
                    allowing the user to enter one of the two solving modes. </p>
