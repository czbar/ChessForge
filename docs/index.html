            Windows desktop application facilitating chess studies and training. </p>

        <p>It can be used to build opening repertoires, study endgames, middle game strategy and tactics.
            For training, it offers the unique Training Mode plus two distinct solving modes for solving exercices.</p>

        <p><b>Chess Forge</b> utilizes lichess.org public API to bring you the Opening Explorer and Endgame Tablebases.
            That includes the list of Top Games for the current position from lichess's master database.
            The games can be conveniently previewed before optional import. </p>

                <p>
                    Note that currently the installer is not digitally signed, so the browser and/or the Windows system
                    will likely issue a few warnings. </p>

                <h2>Open a Workbook</h2>
                <p>You can open a workbook from either the local disk or from the ChessForge online library. </p>
                <h3>From a local file</h3>
                <p>Select <code>File->Open</code> from the main menu and choose a workbook.
                    There are a few samples distributed with the installation and you can find them in the
                    <code>Documents/{user_name}/Chess Forge</code> folder.</p>

                </p>
                <h3>From the online library </h3>
                Alternatively, if your PC is online, select <code> File->Online Library - Public </code> from the main
                menu to open Chess Forge's Public Library.
                Click on any book in the library to view it. </p>

                <h2>Main Window</h2>
                <p>When you open a given workbook for the first time, it will first show the chapters view.</p>
                <p class="marginimage" padding="200">
                    <img src="images/ChaptersViewGlimpse.jpg"/>
                </p>
                <p>Click on <code>Study</code> or double click the chapter's title to open the Study view. The image
                    below names the various elements of the window.</p>
                    <h3>Self-indexing Study View </h3>
                <p padding="200">
                    <img src="images/MainWindow.jpg" />
                </p>
                <p>If the engine is turned on, the box under the Main Chessboard will show the engine lines instead of user hints.</p>
                <p padding="200">
                    <img src="images/EngineLines.jpg" />
                </p>
                <p>The Study is shown as the, so called, self-indexing view. It includes a Variation Index under the chapter's title. </p>
                <h3>Games View </h3>
                <p>The Games view does not have the Variation Index and it only has one main (bolded) line. That line is the text of the game 
                    i.e. the actual moves as opposed to any comments that may have been added to the game.
                </p>
                <h3>Exercises View </h3>
