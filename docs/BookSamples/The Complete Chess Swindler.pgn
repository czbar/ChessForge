[Preamble "At the strong Tallin tournament of 1971, the game between the grandmasters Furman and Smejkal was drawing to a close. White had already mentally given up and was simply going through the motions to conclude the proceedings."]

 {[%eval +0.47]Impatience is one of the most common human foibles, and chess is 
no exception (…) The desire to finish off a game as quickly as possible is 
perhaps the most common cause of failures to win a won game. Click on the 
Exercises tab to see one of the most famous examples featuring the great Samuel 
Reshevsky.}  *

[White "Pilnick Carl"]
[Black "Reshevsky, Samuel"]
[Result "*"]
[Preamble "Queen endings are perhaps the most protracted of all endgames, and are frequently a catalyst for impatience (and swindles!). It might seem that the position is devoid of resources, but White finds a way to set up one final trap. Key to its success is the fact that while Queen endings are tedious, pawn endings, of course, are much simpler. Pilnick’s move, offers Reshevsky chance to be clever and finish the game immediately."]

[White "Aronian, Levon"]
[Black "Carlsen, Magnus"]
[Result "*"]
[Preamble "The World Champion is two pawns down with a horrible position to boot. His bishops are hopelessly hemmed in by White’s commanding pawns on d5 and f6, and his kingside is in tatters. Knowing that he has minimal survival chances following a normal course of events, Carlsen makes a calculated gamble:"]


 {[%eval +2.05]}  Bxd5 $3 {[%eval +2.27]Snatching White's trump card, Black also 
puts himself in a seemingly paralysing d-file pin. The pin is so debilitating 
that White wins slowly with any “normal” move such as 2.Rf5! (eyeing up the 
pawns on e5 and h5) or 2.a3! evicting Black’s most active piece. But Aronian 
thinks he spots an immediate execution, and, after only 90 seconds of thought, 
he plunges head-first into the trap:}  2. Bc5 $4 {[%eval +0.80]}  Rd4 $3 {[%eval 
+0.74]The brutal point of Black’s play. With one beautiful swoop, Carlsen 
simultaneously cuts off the lines of communication on the d-file and the g1-a7 
diagonal. No matter how White captures next, a cruel intermediate move awaits 
him. If 3.Bxf8 Rxd1+! and Black saves the piece, 3.Rxd4 Bxc5! turns the pinner 
into the pinned. A zwischenzug followed Aronian’s choice as well.}  (2... Bxc5 
{[%eval +5.12]}  3. Qxc5 {[%eval +3.98]} ) 3. Bxd4 {[%eval +0.68]}  Bxf3 {[%eval 
+0.42]}  4. gxf3 {[%eval +0.31]}  exd4 $14 {[%eval +0.26]And, although White 
retains an edge, the tables have certainly turned. The game was eventually 
drawn, Aronian’s impatience having cost him a famous victory.}  *
