                   identifying PGN "game" types as Studies, Games or Exercises in the Chess Forge's context etc.

                    If you do not want indexing, set the default indexing depth to 0. 
                    Any new Study will then open without the index.  
                </p>
                <p>However, you can immediately enable indexing by simply clicking 
                    the Study's title.
