        <p>Chess Forge offers rich editing tools for creating workbooks. Those workbooks are text files in the PGN format and can be easily shared.</p>
        <p>One typical scenario is for a coach to author a workbook and share it with their pupils. Apart from all the usual ways of sharing files via email 
            or various other application, ChessForge supports online libraries that can be accessed directly from the program.</p>

            <p>We believe that Chess Forge, with its several unique functions is one of the most, if not the most capable PGN viewer/editor. </p>

                    If you do not want indexing, set the default indexing depth to 0. 
                    Any new Study will then open without the index.  
                </p>
                <p>However, you can immediately enable indexing by simply clicking 
                    the Study's title.
