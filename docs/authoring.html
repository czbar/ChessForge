        <p>Chess Forge offers rich editing tools for creating workbooks. Those workbooks are text files in the PGN
            format and can be easily shared.</p>
        <p>One typical scenario is for a coach to author a workbook and share it with their pupils. Apart from all the
            usual ways of sharing files via email
            or various other application, ChessForge supports online libraries that can be accessed directly from the
            program.</p>
        <p>Read about <a href="https://github.com/czbar/ChessForge/wiki/Online-Libraries" target="_blank">Online
                Libraries</a> in the
            User's Manual</p>

            <h2>Workbooks</h2>
            <article class="release">
                <p>Chess Forge organizes its content as the, so called, workbooks. Physically, workbooks are just text
                    files in the PGN format with some
                    Chess Forge specific extensions.</p>
                <p> Those extensions, include extra tags identifying the file as a ChessForge workbook, extra headers
                    identifying PGN "game" types as Studies, Games or Exercises in the Chess Forge's context etc.
                </p>
                <p>Each workbook contains one or more chaters and within chapters:
                <ul>
                    <li>An optional Intro</li>
                    <li>A Study</li>
                    <li>Any number of Games</li>
                    <li>Any number of Exercises</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>You can create a new workbook from scratch or start by importing a PGN file. Then you can edit it
                    using Chess Forge's unique capabilities.</p>

                <h2>General Editing</h2>
                <p>This section applies to Studies, Games and Exercises i.e. views that display a variation tree.</p>
                <p>In each such view, there is always one selected move/position indicated by the highlighting
                    and reflected on the main chessboard.
                </p>
                <p>If there is no highlighted move/position, it means that the starting position has been selected. In
                    particular, that will be the case when you open a Study for the first time.
                </p>
                <p> Most of the editing will be done by entering moves with the mouse. Moves are appended to the
                    currently selected one and branches
                    will be created where other move have already been added previously.</p>

                <h3>Managing Lines</h3>
                <p> We will refer to branches of the variation tree as lines, as per the standard chess terminology.
                    Lines can be selected and <i>(coming in version 1.8)</i> re-ordered.</p>

                <h3>Copy/Paste Moves, Lines and Trees</h3>
                <p> A unique feature of Chess Forge as a PGN editor is the ability to copy and paste moves, lines and
                    trees within
                    the same view or across views/chapters/workbooks.</p>
                <p>
                    You can copy moves, lines and trees from any Chess Forge view or from any text with valid algebraic
                    notation (not necessarily PGN).
                </p>
                <h4>Select and Copy Moves </h4>
                <p>Click on any move to select it. While pressing the SHIFT key, click on another move to select the
                    sequence of moves
                    between the two moves. The selected sequence will be highlighted in blue.
                </p>

                </p>
                <h3>Select and Copy Line </h3>
                <p>Click on any move to select it. Press CTRL-L to select the currently highlighted line.
                    The selection will now be bighlighted in blue.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/CopyPasteLine.jpg" alt="Copy/Paste Line" />
                </p>
                <h4>Select and Copy Tree </h4>
                <p>Click on any move to select it. Press CTRL-A to select the variation sub-tree under the highlighted
                    move.
                    The selected sub-tree will be bighlighted in blue.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/CopyPasteTree.jpg" alt="Copy/Paste Tree" />
                </p>
                <h4>Paste Selected Moves</h4>
                <p>Navigate to the target view (variation tree) and select a move at which you want to paste the
                    selection.
                </p>
                <p class="marginimage">
                    <img src="images/PrePasteMoves.jpg" alt="Pre-Paste Moves" />
                </p>
                <p>Press CTRL-V. If the move sequence can be legally inserted at the selected move, it will be pasted.
                    Note that, in the example shown here, you could have selected 3.Bb5 as well.
                    Chess Forge checks if the moves can be pasted at the selected location or at the next ply
                    (it will match the side on the move in the target position and in the selection being pasted).
                </p>
                <p>If we used the Copy/Paste Tree option, the end result will be as shown as in the image below.</p>
                <p class="marginimage">
                    <img src="images/PostPasteMoves.jpg" alt="Post-Paste Moves" />
                </p>
                <p>Note that the actual move numbering does not matter. You can try pasting the moves anywhere.
                    If the moves cannot be legally inserted in the specified place, Chess Forge will abort the action
                    and flash a warning message in the Hints box
                    under the main chessboard.

                <h2>Copy/Paste PGN Games</h2>
                <p>
                    You can place a PGN game or even multiple games in the system cliboard and press CTRL-V when in
                    ChessForge.
                    If the program recognizes the content of the clipboard as valid PGN it will offer to add it to the
                    current chapter.
                </p>
                <p>If the program recognizes the content as copied from a Chess Forge's PGN and it recognizes the
                    special Chapter or Intro tags
                    it will offer to add those chapters into the current workbook.

                <h2>Editing Intro View</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike the views discussed earlier, the Introduction view (or Intro view for short) doesn't contain
                    a variation tree.
                    Instead, it's designed to provide a free-form text description and notes about the upcoming chapter.
                    You can format the text similarly to Microsoft Word's rich text formatting, and you can also insert
                    diagrams and moves for illustration purposes. </p>
