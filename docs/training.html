        <p>The idea of checking one's understanding and memorizing chess variations by testing against a wokbook
            is not new.
            However, we found the restrictions imposed by most tools, chessable.com being the most notable example,
            rather constraining, if not outright annoying.</p>
        <p>While we appreciate and understand the value of such sites and tools, we don't like being forced into a
            strict workflow, with
            the spaced repetition algorithm determing what we do next. </p>
        <p>The idea of Chess Forge was born when we decided that we wanted a <b>free-style</b> training and we couldn't
            find a
            tool that would do exactly
            what we needed.

                <p>Here, we are presenting just a quick overview. Please refer to the Training section of the User's
                    Guide for details.</p>

            <h2>Free Style Training</h2>
            <article class="release">
                <p>
                    What do we mean by <i>Free Style Training</i> ? Well, a couple of things:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You choose a variation you want to test yourself against and the position you want to start
                        from.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you encounter a fork, the program will let you choose which branch to follow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can go back to any move at any point.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the workbook line finishes, the program starts a game with the engine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can show or hide engine evaluations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p> Again, we have to stress that we are not stating that this mode of training/testing is better than
                    the more restrictive ones. In fact, we know that <i>the spaced repetition</i>
                    approach can be very effective. We are simply presenting an alternative that you may find more
                    suitable for you or at least more enjoyable.</p>
