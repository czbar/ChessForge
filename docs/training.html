        <p>Chess Forge offers rich editing tools for creating workbooks. Those workbooks are text files in the PGN
            format and can be easily shared.</p>
        <p>One typical scenario is for a coach to author a workbook and share it with their pupils. Apart from all the
            usual ways of sharing files via email
            or various other application, ChessForge supports online libraries that can be accessed directly from the
            program.</p>
