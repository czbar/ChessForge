        <p>The idea of checking one's understanding and memorizing of chess variations by testing it against a wokbook is, of course, not new.
        However, we found the restrictions imposed by most tools, chessable.com being the most notable example, rather constraining, if not outright annoying.</p>
        <p>While we appreciate and understand the value of such sites and tools, we don't like being forced into a strict workflow, with
            the spaced repetition algorithm determing what we do next. </p>
        <p>Chess Forge idea was born when we decided that we wanted a "free-style" training and we couldn't find a tool that would do exactly
            what we needed.

            <h2>Free Style Training</h2>
            <article class="release">
                <p> 
                    What do we mean by <i>Free Style"</i>? Well, a couple of things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You choose a variation you want to test yourself against and the position you want to start from.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When you encounter a fork, the program will let you choose which branch to follow. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can go back to any move at any point.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the workbook line finishes, the program starts a game with the engine.   
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can show or hide engine evaluations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> Again, we have to stress that we are not stating that this mode of training/testing is better than the more restrictive ones. In fact, we know that <i>the spaced repetition</i>
                approach can be very effective. We are simply presenting an alternative that you may find more suitable for you or at least more enjoyable.</p>
